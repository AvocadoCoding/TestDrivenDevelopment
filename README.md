# TestDrivenDevelopment
An application that creates a web page with team members names and details, based on user inputs. 

## About the project
I have written a team contact details web page creator application using javascript and node.js. Using the npm inquirer module the user is prompted for the team personel information, with the manager information requested and then the option to add further engineers and interns to the team page. The code was also written to satidfy the test files, which were checked using the npm jest module.

Once the user has entered all of the team inforamtion a 'team.html' file is created from a template literal with the input user data and the file is saved in the 'ouput' folder.
